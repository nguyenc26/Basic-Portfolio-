                My name is Cuong Nguyen. I graduated from Augsburg University in 2016 with a double major in Biology and Psychology. Currently, I work at the University of Minnesota in Housing and Residential Life as an Assistant Residence Director. I am currently enrolled in the Coding Bootcamp to switch careers. Some of my hobbies include cooking, biking, collecting watches, and collecting Funkopop figures.
